          The Development assignment required students to design and implement a
          fully usable aggregator using React, which included features for
          filtering and sorting elements on a page and adding them to a
          subsection of the screen devoted to organizing "favorites" or a
          "cart." By performing a competitive analysis at the start of the
          assignment, designs were based off of the perceived strengths of three
          different designs so they could take advantage of how effective
          aggregators have been implemented in industry.

      <h1><sup>01</sup> Competitive Analysis</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          For my three example websites, I chose Spotify, Pinterest, and Amazon.
          Although the three sites had a lot of features in common (like
          user-created lists, different view specs, and searching within lists),
          their designs differed slightly within how they balanced master lists
          and user-created lists.

        <div class="three-up">
          <div>
            <h2>
              <a href="https://spotify.com/" target="_blank"
                ><sup>01</sup> Spotify</a
              >
            </h2>
            <p>
              Given their main function of curating music for users, Spotify had
              more advantages for filtering and saving favorites locally by
              revolving around user-created folders. However, Spotify lacked a
              "master list" for all saved songs unlike the other two sites,
              which could be helpful when users look for songs that they saved
              but might not remember the location of.

              <br /><br />
              In terms of its design, Spotify devotes most of the screen to
              playlists and songs in a given playlist. By simplifying each
              action into an icon that can display on hover for favoriting songs
              and using similarity to group similar actions together (such as
              the “favorite” icon in multiple locations wherever a song
              appears), Spotify highlights the main actions it wants its users
              to take without being too cluttered.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>
              <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/" target="_blank"
                ><sup>02</sup> Pinterest</a
              >
            </h2>
            <p>
              Like Spotify, Pinterest had user-created lists and one-click
              saving, but it also had an unorganized master list, which made it
              easier to see all saves in one location, and its view specs
              differed in the level of detail displayed rather than page layout.
              However, Pinterest didn’t have any way to filter content by media
              type or topic.
              <br /><br />
              Pinterest’s design sits between Spotify and Amazon’s in terms of
              complexity with both a tree layout and one-click saves. This
              allows for Pinterest to display the most pertinent actions while
              adding complexity when commenting or writing notes on pins.
              Instead of showing both lists and items, Pinterest spotlights the
              items themselves, relying on similarity and repetition to unify
              the page; this also allows users to focus on the pins, with boards
              being secondary.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>
              <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"
                ><sup>03</sup> Amazon</a
              >
            </h2>
            <p>
              With master lists, user-created lists, and filtering, Amazon makes
              it easy to find saved items. Furthermore, its qualitative customer
              ratings also add to its credibility compared to Pinterest and
              Spotify, which use more quantitative metrics. However, Amazon does
              not support one-click saves or saving favorites locally.
              <br /><br />
              Amazon’s design is more robust than the other two sites; buttons
              for saving or adding items to one’s cart sit beside the info,
              highlights the products themselves. With grouping, Amazon makes
              information easy to peruse while creating a nuanced experience
              with more visible options. However, by using similarity within
              text links versus various kinds of buttons, Amazon allows users to
              do more without compromising visual clarity.

          Given that having a master list, one-click save, and view specs were
          three features that were not universal across the aggregators, yet
          still features that seemed to be beneficial for the user experience, I
          decided to implement these three functions as part of my website.
          <br /><br />
          Although other features like user-created lists and filtering within
          lists were also helpful, given the scope of the assignment to
          encompass smaller numbers of items, I felt that it didn't make much
          sense to implement user-created lists and filtering within lists given
          the small number of items.

        <img alt="Lofi mockups" src="media/lofi.png" />
        <p>
          Starting with lofi mockups, I sketched some different screens for how
          the user journey might look as they navigate through the site. Taking
          careful consideration with the interfacing of different menus, I also
          played around with page layout and how it might be affected by the
          opening and closing of different compartments on the page.
        </p>
        <img alt="Hifi mockups" src="media/hifi.png" />
        <p>
          After some revision, I took the lofi mockups into a higher fidelity,
          adding color and font to determine the visual style of the pages. The
          designs changed throughout the development process as I discovered
          holes in my user flow and changed the designs to match potential user
          actions, but the core of the visual identity and experience stayed
          relatively consistent.

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          My final website is an interface detailing various museums in New York
          that I felt were relevant for cultural (art) education and interesting
          places to visit while in the area. The two buttons in the top left
          corner allow for viewing two different aggregators, one for a master
          list (favorites), and another for a more specific list (save for
          later).
        </p>
        <img alt="Favorites menu" src="media/menu 1.png" />
        <p>
          Within these lists, users have the ability to switch between grid and
          list views of the data given the limited real estate on the screen.
          Using a more typical convention, menus can be closed by both clicking
          on the button that opened them, and also by clicking the "Close"
          button in the bottom of the menu. The three menus employ similar
          design principles so they can be grouped visually and experienced
          similarly in terms of the visual language, actions, and motion
          implemented.
        </p>
        <img alt="Favorites menu" src="media/menu 2.png" />
        <p>
          Within each card displayed on the page, users have the ability to view
          information and visit links to the museum sites upon hovering, and
          they are also able to add and remove elements from both lists using
          the corresponding buttons on the cards. A filter menu, opened via the
          icon in the bottom left, allows for users to simultaneously sort by
          museum ticket price and filter based on area and genre. The number of
          results, like the number of favorited or saved items, is displayed in
          the filter menu for consistency and to show when there may be no
          results returned. All of the menus have the ability to clear filters
          or aggregated items.

          Overall, even though it was a difficult process to navigate through
          the different hooks while keeping track of all the moving parts of my
          application, I thought it was an informative way of translating market
          research into stronger products. Additionally, finding the most
          visually appealing way of displaying data while creating a fluid and
          satisfying experience is an ongoing challenge, but being able to
          create a usable prototype was a fulfilling way to learn how
          translating designs into code could be applied to real-life projects.
